class CNNImageForgeryDetector(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    """
    A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for detecting image forgery using recompression analysis.

    This class implements an advanced image forgery detection system that leverages the principles of
    JPEG compression artifacts. It employs a unique approach of comparing an original image with its
    recompressed version to identify potential manipulations.

    Key features:
    1. Recompression-based analysis: Utilizes JPEG compression artifacts for forgery detection.
    2. CNN architecture: Employs a custom CNN for learning and detecting forgery patterns.
    3. Preprocessing pipeline: Includes image decoding, recompression, and difference computation.
    4. Compatibility: Inherits from sklearn's BaseEstimator and ClassifierMixin for easy integration.

    Detection process:
    1. Decodes the input JPEG image.
    2. Recompresses the image using a specified quality factor.
    3. Computes the difference between the original and recompressed images.
    4. Feeds this difference into a CNN for classification.

    The CNN architecture is designed to learn subtle patterns in the compression artifact
    differences that indicate potential forgery. This method is particularly effective for
    detecting manipulated areas in JPEG images, as these areas often respond differently
    to recompression compared to authentic regions.

    Usage:
    - Initialize the detector with desired parameters (compression quality, image size, etc.)
    - Use the fit() method to train the model on a set of images
    - Use the predict() method to detect forgery in new images

    Note: This detector is optimized for JPEG images and may require adaptation for other formats.
