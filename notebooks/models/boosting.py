    """
    Custom Boosting Classifier for ensemble learning.

    This classifier implements a custom boosting algorithm similar to AdaBoost.
    It combines multiple base models to create a strong ensemble classifier.

    Key features:
    - Flexible base model selection: Uses a list of provided base models.
    - Iterative learning: Improves prediction by focusing on misclassified samples.
    - Weighted voting: Final prediction is based on weighted votes of base models.
    - Validation error tracking: Monitors performance on a validation set.

    The algorithm works by:
    1. Iteratively training base models on weighted training data.
    2. Selecting the best performing model in each iteration.
    3. Updating sample weights to focus on misclassified samples.
    4. Combining model predictions using learned weights.

    This classifier is compatible with scikit-learn's API, inheriting from
    BaseEstimator and ClassifierMixin.
